# Dig-In

This project focuses on **Advanced Link Analysis, Geospatial Mapping and Social Network Analysis** (Visualization of connected data-points to analyse their social and mathematical properties) on popular Social media websites. Currently we're targeting Linked-In, Facebook, GitHub, Instagram and Quora. It can be used to create points and track lines, display them on 2D and 3D map.

## Description 

Networks are a powerful and common representation for real world phenomena such as social relations, biological interactions, brain functionality or traffic flows. Nodes in the network can represent individual entities such as persons, proteins, brain regions or places while links between the nodes can model a plethora of relationships: constant flows or exchanged entities, static or dynamic relations, instantaneous events, simultaneous relations, strong or weak relations, and so forth. Networks help us model and express a plethora of information about the real world, yet networks are one of the most complex data sets to understand.

## Purpose

- Identification of key influencers, developers, opinions and more.
- Data visualization
- Fraud investigation
- Threat assessment
- Understaning relationships
- Research

#### Further Use-cases

> In July 2011, it was discovered that vsftpd version 2.3.4 downloadable from the master site had been compromised.  Users logging into a compromised vsftpd-2.3.4 server may issue a ":)" (smiley face) as the username and gain a command shell on port 6200. This was not an issue of a security hole in vsftpd, instead, someone had uploaded a different version of vsftpd which contained a backdoor. Since then, the site was moved to Google App Engine.

Now, in that case, the master website was compromised, and there's nothing much that can be done, but, in GitHub and other code collaboration platforms, [@0x48piraj](https://github.com/0x48piraj) and many other security researchers have identified malware-ized versions of popular open-source software found online as forks. Now, this, on the other hand, delivers a different and subtle security threat. These forks are often made through [sock-puppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)) and are very difficult to trace back, all these puppets are often managed by criminal entities and can be better back-traced/analysed by utilizing our project.

## Existing Work

- [sna-js](https://github.com/craigtutterow/sna-js) that interact with social network APIs, generate D3.js visualizations, and calculate relevant metrics for social network analysis.

- [Social Media Visual Analytics](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/social/) This research is supported in part by an IBM PhD Fellowship, by the DARPA XDATA project, and and by the National Science Foundation via award IIS-1320537.
